# Privacy Policy
Transcopied is a clipboard manager that stores a copy of the data from your clipboard so you can use it again later on.

We consider all data saved from your clipboard as private and sensitive information and therefore no user data saved in the app will ever be transmitted to us or any other third parties.

All of your data is stored in your own private container on iCloud that is tied to your personal Apple ID. We DO NOT have any access to anything stored within your own private iCloud container. Apple secures your data by encrypting it when it is transmitted and stored in iCloud. Please refer to Apple’s iCloud security and privacy overview for more information regarding storing your data on Apple’s iCloud servers.

<!--The Transcopied third party keyboard extension DOES NOT require Full Access to use. If you do have to enable Allow Full Access for access to additional features, note that the keyboard does not log any user input and does not require internet access to use. Full Access is only required if you wish to copy images or save data through the keyboard.-->

# Information We Collect and How We Use It
### Usage Logs

Transcopied automatically logs some app activity for diagnostic purposes. These logs are stored locally on your device and are not automatically transmitted anywhere. The usage logs only contains metadata about data saved and app usage.

### Crash Reports

Transcopied uses Apple's built in crash reporting for app developers. In the event of a crash, a crash report will automatically be shared to us so that we can pinpoint and fix any issues with the app. These crash reports do not contain any identifying information or data that you’ve saved in the app. You may opt-out of automatic crash reporting. To do so, open Settings on your device > Privacy > Analytics, and turn off Share with App Developers.
